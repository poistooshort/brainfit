brainFit is single page web app that is a semi-social network style form of sharing exercises in the form of animated gifs. It looks to bring quick access to exercise reference to users who are short on time and just want simple and quick access to ideas for exercises.

## Lessons Learned

This is my first solo project from ideation through creation. It was definitely kind of a choppy road and my journey isn't finished but I've definitely enjoyed the trip so far. During the process I have discovered that I would like to strengthen my skills in design and project management.
